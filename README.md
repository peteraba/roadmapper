Roadmapper is a CLI tool and webservice designed to help maintaining and tracking roadmaps. Learn more in the [official documentation](https://docs.rdmp.app/).

### Roadmapper uses the following technologies

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - The worldâ€™s most popular front-end component library
- [cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli) - A simple, fast, and fun package for building command line apps in Go
- [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) - High performance, extensible, minimalist Go web framework
- [Canvas](https://github.com/tdewolff/canvas) - Cairo in Go: vector to SVG, PDF, EPS, raster, HTML Canvas, etc.
- [pq](https://github.com/lib/pq) - A pure Go postgres driver for Go's database/sql package
- [pg](https://github.com/go-pg/pg) - Golang ORM with focus on PostgreSQL features and performance
- [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) - Blazing fast, structured, leveled logging in Go
- [uitable](https://github.com/gosuri/uitable) - A go library for representing data as tables for terminal applications.
- [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) - A set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend
- [Dockertest](https://github.com/ory/dockertest) - Integration tests against third party services
- [chromedp](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp) - A faster, simpler way to drive browsers supporting the Chrome DevTools Protocol
- [bindata](https://github.com/kevinburke/go-bindata) - A small utility for embedding binary data in a Go program

#### Furthermore, Roadmapper would not exist as it is without the following giants

- [go](https://github.com/golang/go) - The Go programming language
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Docker provides a simple and powerful developer experience, workflows and collaboration for creating applications.
- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification
- [linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) - a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel.

And probably so many others that came before them.
